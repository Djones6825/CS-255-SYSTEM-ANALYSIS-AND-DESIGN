CS-255 MODULE 8-2 Journal Portfolio




    Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
      Answer: The company the commissioned this work was called DriverPass and they wanted to design a system that helped increase 
      the pass rate of people taking their driving tests. The system allowed users to have multiple tiers of membership that allowed 
      them to schedule tests, have classes, download lessons, as well as in person trainings. This system was meant to manage all 
      of these features and provide administrators with special functions like updating and changing packages based off of what client needs were.
    
    What did you do particularly well?
      Answer: I beleive that I was able to properly grasp what the client's needs were and I created a use cases that 
      would apply to every user to help the product owner prepare for possible pain points. I also feel that I accurately 
      outline which actors needed access to each system and how they could expand their system if they would implement changes.

    
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
      Answer: My Use Case Diagram felt a little too cluttered. I would see other examples of Use Case Diagrams and their 
      organization methods so that I has an easier to follow reading. I would like it to seem clear from a first glance with
      their relationships also clear.

    
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
      Answer: I made a bullet point list of what the user was requiring from the interview transcript. 
      Then I added what would need to be implemented to make those features and requirement function.
      I continued expanded until all of the client's needs were met then I re-evaluated the list to determine if 
      there were any overlap if features and requirments that I could simplify and possibly combine to make a more effecienet system.

    
    How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
      Answer: I try to read the requirements and make a checklist or bullet point list to see what the essential features the client requires.
      I fill out each requirement with what is needed to make each feature function then re-evaluate the list to see 
      what can be combined or if any features overlap. After that, I begin by creating object and what they need in a class 
      diagram and see their relationships. Once I have the features I want written down and reviewed I begin to code a rough 
      outline with basic features according to the class diagram and start connecting them from the relationships.
